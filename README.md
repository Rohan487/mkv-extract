# MKV Extract

Extract MKV subtitles and attachments directly from the browser: https://qgustavor.github.io/mkv-extract/

1. Open or drop a MKV file
2. Wait a while...
3. ???
4. Profit!

No downloads or uploads, no extensions, no plugins, no complicated things.
Extract .ASS and .SRT subtitles and also any kind of attachment.

*Build with:*

* [node-ebml](https://github.com/themasch/node-ebml), for MKV parsing;
* [filereader-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/filereader-stream), for streaming files;
* [progress-stream](https://github.com/freeall/progress-stream), for statistics;
* [jszip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip), because it's simpler downloading one file than a lot of files;
* [filesaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js), because it's easy to use;
* [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), because it's simple;
* [google-closure-compiler-js](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-js), because I like it;
* [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages), because it's pratical;
* [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard), why not?
